A vibration system with three degrees of freedom, M,K,C is known, and the load f3(t)=F*e**jwt is applied only on the third degree of freedom. According to the theory of modal analysis of multi-degree-of-freedom structure: 1. Draw the amplitude-frequency characteristic curve, phase-frequency characteristic curve, real-frequency characteristic curve, imaginary-frequency characteristic curve of H22(w), H12(w), and the solid-frequency characteristic curve. 2.
Draw the amplitude-frequency characteristic curve, phase-frequency characteristic curve, real-frequency characteristic curve, and imaginary-frequency characteristic curve of H22(w) and H12(w). 2. Find the intrinsic frequency and damping ratio of the structure through the frequency response curve
